# YahooFantasyMessages

The original purpose was to archive forum messages, as Yahoo had a 100 post archival limit. Later Yahoo introduced threads, so this problem (for the most part) went away.

This was later replaced by: https://github.com/philip/YahooFantasySportsAPI

Granted that's also not maintained (it still, for the most part, works, but it contains bugs).
